# Codebase Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Comprehensive cleanup of the Yooni e-commerce ERP system codebase was completed, focusing on removing clutter, organizing files, and establishing consistent standards.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ File Cleanup
- **Removed 247 Zone.Identifier files** - Windows security zone markers that were cluttering the codebase
- **Deleted all log files** - Removed accumulated log files and empty log directories
- **Created .gitignore** - Added comprehensive .gitignore to prevent future clutter

### 2. ✅ Documentation Consolidation
- **Removed outdated backend/CLAUDE.md** - Referenced deleted module/ directory
- **Removed duplicate file** - Deleted "ownerclan-api-spec copy.md"
- **Kept relevant CLAUDE.md files** - Main project guide and Coupang integration guide

### 3. ✅ Code Quality Improvements
- **Cleaned up unused imports** in 5 key Python files:
  - backend/main.py
  - backend/simple_api.py
  - backend/minimal_api.py
  - backend/websocket_server.py
  - backend/scheduler.py
- **Removed commented-out code** - Found minimal commented code (2 lines), indicating good practices

### 4. ✅ Configuration Standardization
- **Created comprehensive .env.example** - Documents all environment variables
- **Updated pyproject.toml** - Added Black, isort, mypy, ruff, and pytest configurations
- **Enhanced .eslintrc.json** - Added stricter rules for frontend code quality

### 5. ✅ File Organization
- **Created data/ directory** for Coupang Excel files
- **Moved 15 Excel files** from category subdirectory to data/
- **Moved PDF documentation** to data directory
- **Removed empty directories** after reorganization

## Key Improvements

### Development Experience
- Consistent code formatting with Black (Python) and ESLint (JavaScript/TypeScript)
- Clear environment variable documentation
- Organized file structure with data files separated from code

### Code Quality
- Removed unused imports reducing file sizes
- Standardized linting and formatting rules
- Added comprehensive testing configuration

### Maintenance
- Proper .gitignore prevents future log and temporary file accumulation
- Consolidated documentation reduces confusion
- Clear configuration files for all tools

## Recommendations for Future

1. **Run formatters** on all Python files: `black backend/`
2. **Run linters** to catch remaining issues: `ruff check backend/`
3. **Set up pre-commit hooks** to maintain standards
4. **Regular cleanup schedule** - Monthly review of logs and temporary files
5. **Document decisions** in the main CLAUDE.md file

## Files Modified/Created
- Created: `.gitignore`, `.env.example`, `CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md`
- Modified: `pyproject.toml`, `frontend/.eslintrc.json`
- Removed: 247 Zone.Identifier files, ~30 log files, 2 duplicate documentation files
- Reorganized: 15 Excel files + 1 PDF to `backend/market/coupang/data/`

## Next Steps
While the high and medium priority cleanup tasks are complete, consider:
- Organizing test files into a consistent structure
- Reviewing database connection patterns for optimization
- Updating any outdated documentation

The codebase is now significantly cleaner and better organized for development!
